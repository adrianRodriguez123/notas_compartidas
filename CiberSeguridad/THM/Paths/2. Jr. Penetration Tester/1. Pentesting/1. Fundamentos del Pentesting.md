## Penetration Testing Methodologies

1. **Recogida de información:** This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.

	- **Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.

2. **Escaneo:** This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

3. **Explotación:** This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

4. **Escalada de privilegios:** Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

5. **Post-explotación:** This stage involves a few sub-stages:  

	**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

	**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user

	**3.**  Covering your tracks

	**4.** Reporting


### OSSTMM 
Provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1.  **Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)**
2.  Wired Networks
3.  Wireless communications


### OWASP
Is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.


### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
Is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

### NCSC CAF
Is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.
